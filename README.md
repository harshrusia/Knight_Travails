# Knight_Travails
This is a beginner level project done to strengthen my knowledge of graph traversals.
The goal of this project is to implement a function #knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another using a Chess Knight. The function will output all squares the knight will move to on its way. This is a variation on the shortest path problem.

This is a project from The Odin Project.
